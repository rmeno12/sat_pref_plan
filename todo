poc setup:
- planning
	- use map of eer (masked for planning now and unmasked for trying learning)
	- use vrl model to create costmap from map
	- do graph search to get across eer lawn (create plan)
- action
	- replan when needed
		- if execution error makes go too far away
		- if map doesn't look like reality
			- how to decide how close?? 
	- set carrot of graph nav to be plan points


for unet training
- should learn to map from sky to embedded local view
  - ie satellite view -> embedding(ground view)
